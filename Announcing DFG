# Designer Fund Announces Designer Founder Guild to Help Designers Build Companies

Today, we’re excited to announce Designer Founder Guild (“DFG”) — a group of exceptional founders who are committed to helping more designers build and scale tech companies. We’re inviting designers from diverse levels of experience and company stages to participate including Evan Sharp, co-founder of Pinterest, and Joe Gebbia, co-founder of Airbnb. All members of DFG believe in giving back and sharing knowledge to help the next generation of designer founders succeed.
